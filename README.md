- **PIN_RED**: Connect to the red leg.
- **PIN_GREEN**: Connect to the green leg.
- **PIN_BLUE**: Connect to the blue leg.

### 7. Connecting the Whadda Model

**Components Needed**: Whadda Model, 5 wires (1 black, 1 red, 3 of any color)

- **GND (Black)**: Connect to the breadboard’s GND.
- **VCC (Red)**: Connect to the 3V3 power on the breadboard.

  - **Whadda Model - Nucleo Pins**:
    - **STB**: Connect to PIN_STB
    - **CLK**: Connect to PIN_CLK
    - **DIO**: Connect to PIN_DIO

## Game Instructions

### 1. Memory Game

Players must memorize and repeat a sequence of lights generated by the Arduino. The sequence length increases with each level.

- **Level 1**: +50 points
- **Level 2**: +100 points
- **Level 3**: +200 points

*Note: Pressing the wrong button stops the game and all points for that level are lost.*

### 2. Color Hunt Game

A random color is chosen. The LED lights up in various colors, and players must press the button when the LED matches the target color.

- **Correct catch**: Time speeds up.
- **Incorrect catch**: Time resets and score is reduced by 20 points.

### 3. Whack-a-Mole Game

Hit the corresponding buttons as LEDs light up on the Whadda model. The game progresses through three levels with increasing difficulty.

- **Level 1**: Beat 45 moles, score 450 points.
- **Level 2**: Beat 30 moles, score 650 points.
- **Level 3**: Beat 15 moles, score 800 points.

**Scoring**:
- **Each mole hit**: +10 points
- **Each mole missed**: -3 points

### 4. Potentiometer Game

Match the pace of a heartbeat sound by adjusting the potentiometer.

- **Correct pace**: +100 points
- **Incorrect pace**: -20 points

*Time Limit*: 10 seconds to hear the beat, 30 seconds to match the pace.
